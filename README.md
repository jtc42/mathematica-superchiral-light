# Mathematica Superchiral Light

Should produce a wave that describes an elliptical helix in space and rotates circularly about the propagation axis with time.

At each minimum in the electric field, the intensity diminishes but the optical chirality doesn't, since the field's orientation shifts dramatically in the regions nearby. 
The net effect, then, should be increased dissymmetry near those minima.
The more eccentric the ellipse - that is, the more reflective the mirror - the greater the dissymmetry factor.

## NOTE

A perfect 50/50 mirror will tend towards higher and higher
dissymmetry, but the intensity at the highly chiral regions
approaches zero, resulting in no interaction. The reflectivity of the
mirror is therefore a tradeoff between
optical chirality ("zilch") and power available for interaction at
the nodes.

The gain,however,comes at the cost of measurement precision.Says Cohen,
The energy density in the dim regions is so small that shot noise
begins to drown out the signal.

The more we enhance the dissymmetry,the noisier the signal.

## OTHER NOTE

The condition for this is two CP waves, counter propagating, with \
opposite handedness. This does NOT require flipping
the phase on the y-component of the counter propagating wave. \
Flipping the phase would flip the handedness if propagating
in the same direction, however flipping the wavevector k instead acts \
exactly like a mirror. 
From the point of view of the cavity, flipping k produces a counter \
propagating wave of opposite handedness simply by the fact
that the wave is travelling in the opposite direction.
Flipping the phase as well as k would be equivalent to both a mirror \
and a 90 degree QWP!

## Comparison to elliptical light

At the nodes of an elliptical field, the "twist" is largest as it is \
here. It's a bit like sitting at the node of a sine wave,
the gradient is at its maximum. For chiral light, this means the \
"twist" around that spatial point is huge. HOWEVER, in elliptical
propagating light, the wave moves through any point and so this large \
twist is only temporary (ie, as the field sweeps through the \
squeezed-looking bit. 
Here, the standing wave allows regions of space to constantly \
experience this huge twist. Sitting on an imperfect node means some \
intensity is present, 
and a huge twist is constantly existing around that point.
